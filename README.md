# counter

Clone the counter template code from here: https://github.com/apprenticecloud/counter

In this task your are supposed to add functionality for the `+10`, `+15`, `+20` buttons

The `+5` button functionality is already done for you as an example.

Description of what should happen when the buttons are clicked is described below.

the value in the `<h1>` tag should increment based on the value of the button clicked

e.g;

if the value in the button is `+10` it should take the previous value in the `<h1>` tag and increment 10 to it.
this is also what should happen if the `+20` button is clicked. The previous value should be taken and 20 added onto it.

**NOTE:** Stick to the function approach because that is what we covered today and it would suite you best if you deeply understood functions.
