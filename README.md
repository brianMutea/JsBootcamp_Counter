# counter

Clone the counter template code from here: https://github.com/apprenticecloud/counter

In this task your are supposed to add functionality for the `+10`, `+15`, `+20` buttons

The `+5` button functionality is already done for you as an example.

Description of what should happen when the buttons are clicked is described below.

the value in the `<h1>` tag should increment based on the value of the button clicked

e.g;

if the value in the button is `+10` it should take the previous value in the `<h1>` tag and increment 10 to it.
this is also what should happen if the `+20` button is clicked. The previous value should be taken and 20 added onto it.

**NOTE:** Stick to the function approach because that is what we covered today and it would suite you best if you deeply understood functions.

# Advanced task

## Heads or Tails

If you feel the challenge above is a basic assignment and you completed it within a split second here is some juice.

Create a heads or tails game that will be played by a real person and a computer.

The game should go for 5 rounds and the winner will be determined by who guessed the most rights on the 5 rounds.

example:

**round 1:**

computer guessed tails and you guessed heads

outcome: heads

you get a 1 and computer gets a 0 (zero)

**round 2:**

computer guessed tails and you guessed heads

outcome: heads

you get a 2 and computer gets a 0 (zero)

**round 3:**

computer guessed heads and you guessed heads

outcome: heads

you get a 3 and computer gets a 1

**round 4:**

computer guessed tails and you guessed heads

outcome: tails

you get a 3 and computer gets a 2

**round 5:**

computer guessed tails and you guessed heads

outcome: heads

you get a 4 and computer gets a 2

**You become a winner in this set because you guessed the most correct predictions**

**ALSO NOTE:** for the advanced assignment you will need to start off from scratch i.e; HTML, CSS and JS. Push it to its' own github repository. Don't mix the 2 assignments.

**All assignments should be hosted on github pages and links submitted to google classroom**

This is the coin side that will be used. They can be found in the **assets/images** folder
